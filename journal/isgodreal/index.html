        <p>The question of whether God exists has been debated for centuries. Let's examine the evidence. Feel free to contact us at @ave.33 on Signal if you believe you have refuted any part of this.</p>
        <p>First we have to establish some principles. Most people would casually agree with the following but for the sake of philosophy we are going to provide self-evident truths that are irrefutable to further prove them on a more solid basis.</p>
        <h2>The Law of Non-Contradiction</h2>
        <p><strong>Premise 1: </strong>Nothing can come from absolute nothingness because absolute nothingness has no potential since it is the complete absence of all matter, energy and existence.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 2: </strong>For something to give up its own existence, it would need the capacity to perform an action, but such an action would require persistence, which contradicts the idea of total erasure. Something can't turn into absolute nothingness.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 3: </strong>Nothingness and Existence cannot exchange each other, because above we proved that they can never change to each other (Premise 1,2).</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 4: </strong>If something exists, it cannot return to absolute non-existence. While it may transform or change form within existence, it can never lose its persistence as existence and become non-existence, as proven in Premise 2.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 5: </strong>If something exists but is also non-existent, then it cannot persist at all in any form of existence, implying it never existed in the first place, because losing persistence implies becoming non-existence (Premise 4) and becoming non-existence is impossible (Premise 2).</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 6: </strong>All contradictions under the LNC, no matter if property, relation, truth, entity, quality, etc, function as a to exist or to not exist contradiction, which we have proven to be inherently impossible.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The Law of Non-Contradiction is a consequence of existence, not of any logical framework.</p>
        <h2>The Law of Identity</h2>
        <p><strong>Premise 1: </strong>An identity must always be distinguishable from another to exist as its own unique and immutable entity.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 2: </strong>If an identity is not distinguishable from another, it collapses into a single entity, as there can be no differentiation.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 3: </strong>It is impossible for two different identities that are indistinguishable to persist as separate entities, as they are, in fact, the same (Premise 1, 2).</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 4: </strong>As already discussed and proven in the premises for the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC, Premises 1-4) Nothing cannot become something, and something cannot become nothing. If an identity exists, it must persist in some form of existence without transitioning into non-existence.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 5: </strong>If an entity claims to also not be itself or to be its opposite, it loses its distinct identity and can no longer persist as itself. (LI, Premise 1-4) Losing persistence implies falling into non-existence, which is impossible as already proven in the LNC as well, making this scenario invalid.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The Law of Identity is a consequence of existence, not of any logical framework.</p>
        <h2>The Law of Excluded Middle</h2>
        <p><strong>Premise 1: </strong>Existence and Non-Existence are mutually exclusive and exhaustive states. An entity must either exist in some form or not exist at all. There is no intermediate condition between being and non-being because existence itself is absolute and comprehensive.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 2: </strong>Non-existence is defined as the total absence of being, matter, potential, or any form of presence. Because non-existence lacks any properties or potential, it cannot manifest any state of existence or change into existence, as already demonstrated in the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC, Premises 1-2).</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 3: </strong>If something exists, it cannot be non-existent in the same respect and at the same time, as proven by the Law of Identity (LI, Premises 1-3). Therefore, every entity or proposition either pertains to existence or fails to exist, without any possible overlap or middle state.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 4: </strong>If there were an intermediate state between existence and non-existence, it would either contain some aspect of being (and thus exist) or be void of all presence (and thus be non-existent). Any attempt to conceive of an in-between state inherently collapses into either existence or non-existence, as no properties can belong to a state that is neither.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 5: </strong>Degrees of uncertainty, superposition, or potentiality—whether in metaphysics, quantum mechanics, or abstraction—still rely on the existence of a framework or system. These conditions exist within the domain of being and do not suggest a third state between existence and non-existence. Uncertainty pertains to the state of what is, not a challenge to the binary nature of existence.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 6: </strong>Any proposition or truth statement, when referencing reality, must point either to the existence of something or the absence thereof. The truth of a statement, as in reality, affirms either the presence (existence) or the negation (non-existence) of what it references. There is no middle ground, for all possible conditions of truth correspond to existence or non-existence.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The Law of Excluded Middle is a consequence of existence, not of any logical framework.</p>
        <p><strong>Across all three laws, denying any premise leads to the collapse of existence itself.</strong></p>
        <h2><strong>The Proof of God</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>We have successfully proven the three laws to be fundamentally self-evident, not reliant on any logic. We will now apply them to our proof for God.</strong></p>
        <h2>Part 1</h2>
        <p><strong>Premise 1: Absolute nothingness has no potential.</strong> Absolute nothingness, by definition, has no potential for anything to arise. If something had potential within it, it would no longer be considered absolute nothingness but rather a state of potentiality or some form of existence. The absence of potential is inherent to the nature of nothingness because potential itself requires the existence of something to give rise to a future state. Nothingness cannot possess the capacity for creation, transformation, or emergence because these all imply a form of existence, which is absent in true nothingness.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 2: Something exists right now.</strong> This is an undeniable observation. We perceive reality, interact with entities, and experience both the physical and metaphysical. The existence of reality, whether it be the universe, matter, energy, or consciousness, is self-evident. To deny existence would be self-refuting, as the very act of denying something implies the existence of a thinker, a proposition, and the act of denial itself.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 3: As soon as nothingness exists, nothing can exist anymore.</strong> If absolute nothingness were ever to exist, nothing could follow from it. There would be no potential, no framework, no laws, and no capacity for emergence. If nothingness had ever existed in the past, then existence could never have arisen from it. Therefore, the existence of something now disproves the possibility of absolute nothingness ever having existed, as nothingness cannot produce existence, nor can it coexist with or transition into existence.</p>
        <p><strong>Premise 4: Therefore, since something exists right now, nothingness could never have existed.</strong> Since we observe the existence of entities, and nothingness has no potential to give rise to anything, it follows that absolute nothingness could never have existed. The persistence of existence proves that there has always been something—whether it be a fundamental cause, an unchanging entity, or a necessary being. The reality that something exists right now shows that at no point could the state of absolute nothingness have been true, because existence cannot arise from nothingness.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion: Existence is eternal, and nothingness is impossible.</strong>Since something exists now and nothingness could never have existed, there must be an eternal source of existence—something that has always existed without beginning or end. This eternal existence, being the foundation of all reality, is not contingent upon any external cause or potentiality. It simply <i>is</i>, and from this, we infer the necessity of an uncaused, self-sustaining source of existence.</p>
        <h2>Part 2</h2>
        <p><strong>We already concluded that existence/potential must have always existed. We will systematically go through all options on how potential got actualized and something began to exist.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Option 1: Infinite Regress</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Premise:</strong> The concept of infinite regress suggests that every cause or event has a preceding cause, which in turn has another cause, and so on, continuing infinitely backward. <strong>Rebuttal:</strong> An infinite regress implies that there is no true beginning to existence—every event or entity is caused by something else, with no ultimate first cause. However, for something to exist now, there must be a foundation or starting point. An endless chain of causes would leave existence without a firm grounding. The very fact that something exists now implies that there must be a sufficient cause for existence. In an infinite regress, each cause is dependent on the previous, with no explanation for why the chain exists in the first place. Without a first cause, the entire chain lacks a foundation, meaning the present state of existence has no sufficient explanation. This contradicts the self-evident truth that things must have sufficient reasons to exist. Existence cannot be explained by an endless chain with no origin because such a chain does not lead to any definitive source of being. If every cause is contingent on another, then no cause is ultimately necessary. Yet, the undeniable fact that something exists right now points to the necessity of a source that provides existence without itself requiring another cause.</p>
        <p><strong>Option 2: Self-Creation</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Premise: </strong>Self-creation suggests that something can create itself, that it can bring itself into existence. <strong>Rebuttal: </strong>For something to create itself, it would have to already exist before its own creation. This is self-contradictory. It would require something to both exist and not exist at the same time, which is an impossibility. The idea of self-creation violates the fundamental nature of existence itself, which states that something cannot both be and not be simultaneously. It is self-evident that something cannot give rise to itself, just as a blank page cannot write a story without an external cause. By definition, creation implies the act of something bringing something else into being. If an entity creates itself, it must pre-exist its own creation, which is nonsensical. Existence cannot spontaneously generate from non-existence, because non-existence has no potential, no capacity, and no framework to generate anything. Any theory of self-creation implicitly assumes the pre-existence of the entity trying to create itself, which negates the very idea of "self-creation." In reality, this option does not offer any valid explanation for the origin of existence and is immediately ruled out as self-contradictory and impossible.</p>
        <p><strong>Option 3: A Necessary Universe</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Premise: </strong>The necessary universe posits that the universe itself, or multiverse, is necessary and eternal, existing by its own nature. <strong>Rebuttal: </strong>The universe is composed of changeable, finite parts—matter, energy, time, and space—all of which are subject to decay, transformation, and dependence on conditions. A necessary entity must exist in an unchanging, independent way, but the universe shows evidence of contingency through the Big Bang, entropy, and the laws of physics that govern it. Cosmological evidence, such as the Big Bang theory, shows that the universe had a temporal beginning. If the universe were truly necessary, it would not have a point of origin; it would exist eternally without change. The beginning of the universe contradicts the notion that it is self-existent and necessary. Something that begins cannot be necessary—it relies on external conditions for its initiation. The universe is governed by laws and constants (e.g., gravity, electromagnetism) that are fine-tuned to allow its existence. A necessary being, by definition, would not rely on external laws or frameworks to sustain itself. Since the universe depends on such governing principles, it cannot be the necessary, independent entity responsible for all existence.</p>
        <p><strong>Option 4: Illusion or Simulation</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Premise: </strong>The universe is an illusion, or a simulation, projected by some higher consciousness or advanced technology. <strong>Rebuttal: </strong>If the universe is an illusion or simulation, there must be a real, external entity that is responsible for projecting or running the simulation. This option does not escape the need for a cause; it merely pushes the cause back one step. The existence of the "simulator" still requires an explanation. The illusion itself cannot exist without a true underlying reality or consciousness. Even if the physical universe is illusory, something must exist to experience the illusion. The experience of consciousness, awareness, or perception cannot be an illusion itself without a perceiving entity. Therefore, there must still be a true cause behind the illusion, which leads us back to the necessity of a first cause. If the universe is a simulation, it implies the existence of a creator or designers of the simulation. The simulated reality would be contingent upon the existence of this higher intelligence or system, which then leads us to the question of who or what created the simulators. This creates an infinite regress unless we accept that there is a necessary first cause responsible for all existence, even that of the simulation.</p>
        <p><strong>The Necessary First Cause is the Only Viable Option</strong></p>
        <p>After analyzing all the possibilities, it becomes clear that <strong>A Necessary First Cause</strong> is the only viable option to explain why something exists rather than nothing. Here’s why:</p>
        <p>Something must exist that is uncaused, eternal, and self-sufficient—something that requires no external cause. This being exists out of necessity and does not depend on anything else for its existence. It is the foundation of all existence, providing the reason for everything else that exists. For anything contingent (like the universe) to exist, there must be a being whose existence is necessary and cannot fail to exist. This necessary being is not subject to time, decay, or change, making it eternal and immutable. The existence of a necessary first cause solves the problem of infinite regress and self-creation. It provides the firm foundation upon which all contingent beings and causes rest. Without this first cause, nothing could exist, because every contingent being requires something else to bring it into existence.</p>
        <p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>The Necessary First Cause is the source of all existence, and from its nature, we can infer characteristics like eternality, independence, and self-sufficiency. This aligns with the classical understanding of God—a being that exists by necessity, without beginning or end, and from whom all other things derive their existence.</p>
        <h2>Part 3</h2>
        <p>Now, we will derive the attributes of this Necessary being.</p>
        <p><strong>Eternality (Uncreated): </strong>The Necessary Being must be eternal, without beginning or end. Time is a contingent feature of the universe, meaning that the being that created time must exist outside of it. This eternal nature is a fundamental requirement for the existence of anything else, as the Necessary Being must have always existed to avoid the contradiction of something coming from nothing. If the Necessary Being had a beginning, it would require a cause, making it contingent rather than necessary. Therefore, the Necessary Being is eternal and uncaused.</p>
        <p><strong>Independence (Self-Sufficiency): </strong>The Necessary Being must be entirely independent and self-sufficient. It is not reliant on anything external to itself for its existence, essence, or actions. Its self-existence means it does not derive any part of itself from other beings, conditions, or external factors. Dependence on anything external would imply contingency, which contradicts the idea of a necessary being. This being is completely self-contained and the source of all existence.</p>
        <p><strong>Immutability (Unchanging): </strong>The Necessary Being must be immutable, meaning it cannot change. Change implies a transition from one state to another, which is a feature of contingent beings that have potential for different states. A necessary being must be fully actualized and perfect, with no capacity for change. Change would imply imperfection, incompleteness, or dependence on time. An unchanging being is fully actualized and timeless, reflecting its absolute and necessary nature.</p>
        <p><strong>Simplicity (Non-Composite): </strong>The Necessary Being must be simple, meaning it is not composed of parts. Anything made of parts is contingent on those parts and their arrangement, which would introduce dependence. Therefore, the being must be indivisible and without composition. If the Necessary Being were composite, it would depend on the arrangement or existence of its parts, which is inconsistent with the notion of an independent, necessary being. Simplicity ensures it is indivisible and completely self-existent.</p>
        <p><strong>Omnipotence (All-Powerful): </strong>The Necessary Being must have unlimited power. To bring all things into existence, it must have the power to create, sustain, and govern all things without limitation. Omnipotence does not imply the ability to perform logical contradictions (e.g., creating a square circle or a stone too heavy for it to lift). These are not powers but nonsensical propositions. True omnipotence refers to the capacity to perform all actions that are logically possible and coherent within the framework of existence. As the source of all contingent beings, this being must have the power to create and sustain all of existence, and nothing can exist or act without its sustaining will.</p>
        <p><strong>Omniscience (All-Knowing): </strong>The Necessary Being must possess complete knowledge of all things. Since it is the cause of all existence, it must know everything about what it creates, sustains, and governs. This omniscience is inherently connected to the being's personal nature; a personal being understands not just abstract facts but all knowledge related to intentions, relationships, and purposes. Knowledge is deeply tied to being personal. A purely impersonal force could not possess intentional knowledge or relational understanding. To fully know all things, the Necessary Being must have the capacity for relational and intentional knowledge, which stems from its personal nature. To be the first cause of all things implies having full knowledge of all those things. Omniscience extends to everything that exists, everything that could exist, and all logical truths.</p>
        <p><strong>Omnibenevolence (Perfect Goodness): </strong>The Necessary Being must be perfectly good, as it is the source of all existence, and all perfections must ultimately come from it. Goodness is an inherent attribute of a personal, rational being who sustains all things in existence with purpose and order. Since this being is self-sufficient and eternal, it lacks nothing and has no need for evil or imperfection. Its act of creation and sustenance reflects the goodness inherent in its nature. Evil, by contrast, is a deficiency or corruption of good, which cannot originate from a being that is maximally perfect.</p>
        <p><strong>Omnipresence (All-Present): </strong>The Necessary Being must be present everywhere in existence. Since it is the cause of all things, it must sustain all things at all times, being intimately present to every part of its creation. As the sustaining cause of the universe, the Necessary Being is necessarily present to all things that exist. Its omnipresence ensures that all contingent beings are continually held in existence by its will.</p>
        <p><strong>Necessity: </strong>The Necessary Being exists out of absolute necessity. Its existence is not contingent on anything, and it cannot not exist. Its necessity is fundamental to the fact that something exists at all rather than nothing. The necessary being exists by its very nature. If it could cease to exist, everything else would cease as well, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, its existence is metaphysically necessary and cannot be otherwise.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Nature: </strong>The Necessary Being must be personal, meaning it has the capacity for intention, free will, and rationality. Since an eternal being chose to create at a non-eternal point in time, this implies intention and free will. The act of creation was not a mechanical necessity but a deliberate choice. Choosing to create at a specific point in time implies agency, and agency requires a personal, rational will. An impersonal force would lack the capacity for such deliberate, intentional action. Furthermore, sustaining creation with order, purpose, and moral laws implies rationality and personhood. A true randomness cannot satisfy this specific act of creation. True randomness leads to a contradiction, as a true randomness would imply being outside of any causal chain, which is inherently impossible in existence because everything in existence relies on potential and actualization, as proven and discussed earlier in the 3 Fundamental Laws of Existence.</p>
        <p><strong>Tripersonhood: </strong>If God is personal, then he must possess the highest form of personhood. Given that God is maximally great in every aspect, and being personal is part of this greatness, his personhood must also reflect this maximum perfection. A single personhood would be isolated, and since God is self-sufficient and relational, this isolation contradicts his nature. However, two personhoods are also insufficient because they still lack the dynamic of a freely relational being. Three personhoods (a Trinity) represents the minimum for perfect relational interaction. Since God is maximally great in all aspects, his personhood must also be maximally relational and perfect. The most basic form of relational perfection requires three persons, allowing for free, mutual love and interaction. There can't be more than three personhoods because this would contradict simplicity, as it would introduce a form of complexity.</p>
        <p><strong>Perichoresis (Mutual-Indwelling): </strong>The existence of three personhoods within the Necessary Being implies a perfect, dynamic relationship that is fully self-contained and sufficient. Since this being is maximally great, the relationship between the personhoods must be one of mutual indwelling, where each personhood fully shares in the existence and essence of the others without division or separation. For relational perfection, these personhoods must not simply coexist but actively participate in one another's being, perfectly united in a continuous, self-sustaining interaction. This mutual interpenetration ensures that their relationality is complete and harmonious, without any external dependency, reflecting the highest form of relational existence within a single, unified being.</p>
        <p><strong>Source: </strong>The three personhoods of the Necessary Being must have an inherent order to preserve their distinctness and avoid collapsing into a single identity. If all personhoods were equally originating, there would be no relational distinction between them, violating the premise of three distinct personhoods. The first personhood, by necessity, must be the source, from which the second is generated and the third proceeds. This order prevents contradictions—if the second and third were self-initiating, it would undermine the unity and simplicity of the Necessary Being, leading to a logical breakdown. Furthermore, the third personhood cannot proceed from the second because the second is generated and not an originating source. For the third to proceed from the second would introduce a dependency within the relational structure, making the second a cause rather than a distinct, generated personhood. This would violate the principle of simplicity by introducing unnecessary complexity in the origin of the third personhood, where the first alone must be the source to maintain the internal consistency of the Necessary Being.</p>
        <p><strong>Essence and Energies: </strong>The Necessary Being consists of an immutable essence and active energies. The essence is the unchanging core of this Being, fully self-sufficient, simple, and beyond all comprehension, as it cannot be divided or altered. The energies are the outward expressions of the Being's power and will, through which it interacts with and sustains the universe without affecting the essence. This distinction allows the essence to remain transcendent and unchanged while the energies actively maintain and govern reality. The Being’s immanent aspect refers to its internal, unknowable nature (essence), while its economic aspect refers to its engagement with creation (energies). The tripersonal nature of the Being further ensures distinct personhoods that allow for relational interaction within itself, without external dependence. These personhoods have distinct roles, providing necessary differentiation, yet they all share the same essence. The personhoods’ interactions and distinctions do not violate the simplicity of the Being, as the order within the tripersonhood naturally arises from its structure.</p>
